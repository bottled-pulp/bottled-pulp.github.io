**Welcome to Bottled Pulp**

Join me on a personal journey of discovery through the world of wine, where curiosity meets exploration. With four bottles 
always in rotation, I'll be documenting my tasting experiences, sharing insights into grape varieties, wine styles, and the 
regions that produce them.

Here's how it works:

* **Grape Wednesday**: Each week, I'll share a new grape and wine review, delving into its taste, aroma, and overall character. No 
dinner required!
* **Fact Friday**: Every other Friday, I'll take you on a deeper dive into the regions that produced this wine, exploring 
their history, culture, and grape varieties.

At Bottled Pulp, expertise is not the focus â€“ curiosity and discovery are. Follow me as I learn, taste, and share my 
experiences from vineyards to cellars, and beyond!
